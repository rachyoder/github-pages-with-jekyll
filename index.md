# Welcome to my Corner of the Web
## A blog featuring the ramblings of Rachael Yoder

Everyone needs a good place to put their thoughts. For me it's typically on paper, but I guess this will do.
There are several different topics I would like to cover which include:
* Growth and Development as a programmer
* Observations at the surrounding world and the changes it goes through
* Embarrasing personal stories that I delete the following morning

Follow me through my journey back into the realm of the living as I join the internet once more!
